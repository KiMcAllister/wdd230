        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>As with all chamber of commerce sites, the purpose of the Nebo Chamber of Commerce site is to promote the business interests of the members of the organization and promote the area, attracting additional business, tourism, and people. To break that down into more specific goals, the chamber of commerce site will be both a place for community members to connect with the local businesses and events of the area, and to provide a place for business owners to promote their business and connect with other businesses in the area. THis will be accomplished by providing general community information and history, as well as business events happening in the area. It will also have a way for community members to join the chamber of commerce or to contact the chamber of commerce offices. This way, everyone has a way to find connection to, and ways to support the beautiful nebo community.</p>
