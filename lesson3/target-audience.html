        <h2>Audience Description</h2>
        <p>Although a big part of our website will be to provide a landing page for new businesses and current businesses to join the Nebo Chamber of Commerce, we don't want to limit our audience to those seeking to fill out an online form for their business. We want to focus our efforts on connecting to the community focused adults of the nebo area. We want it to be accessible by people with a full spectrum of technological savviness. This will include business owners as well as consumers.</p>
        <h2>The Business Owner</h2>
        <p>The biggest thing a business owner will be looking to do by navigating to our website is to get information on the chamber of commerce and its related involvement in the community. They will want to have a way to join the chamber as well as contact it if needed. A small niche in the “business owner” persona we would like to cater to as well is the prospective community business owner. They will be doing the same as a current community business owner except they will also be looking to see if the community will be a good fit for them as well. To cater to both of these we will make sure the way to get involved in the chamber of commerce is clear and easily accessible/usable. Most of the access from this persona would be through a computer as their access to the website will be from working or working related.</p>
        <h2>The Consumer</h2>
        <p>The consumer will be jumping on our website to learn about their community of local businesses. They will want to learn more about their community and how they can get involved. They will most likely be middle aged, and range in technological ability. The site will have a way for them to learn about their community and the current local businesses they can support. They will be accessing the website from whatever technology they have available, so the site will need to be clear and easy to use from all screen sizes.</p>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What new businesses recently opened up in the community? You will be able to find business spotlights on the main page of the site.</li>
            <li>What local restaurants are there in my area? On the directory page you can find a list of local businesses.</li>
            <li>How do I/my business join the chamber of commerce? On the join page you can take the steps needed to submit an application to join.</li>

            <li>What similar businesses are there to mine in the community, and how can I contact them? On the Directory page there will be information on the local businesses as well as their contact information.</li>
