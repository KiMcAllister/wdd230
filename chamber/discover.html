            <p>
                The Nebo Chamber of commerce was established in 2002 by the former mayor, John Smith. 
                Since then we have been hapily connecting buisness owners and the nebo community together!
                Originally just serving the Nephi and Mona areas, we quickly realized the need for small
                business owners in other juab county locations to connect with eachother, and have a common 
                place for local residents to look for businesses in their area that have strong standards and 
                a great sense of comminity. Since 2005 we have served Levan, and in 2010 the first business in 
                Dog Valley and Rocky Ridge joined the Commerce.
