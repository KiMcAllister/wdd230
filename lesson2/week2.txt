‚ñ∫ Peer Review: Commit and push your page to your GitHub Pages repository. 

Share your design principles web page URL in the W02 Discussion: Developer Forum for peer review. Review peer submissions and offer constructive feedback, using validation tools and the frontend checklist. Update your own page after reviewing any comments left on your site.
üí°  The sooner you can post a working page in the week the better in order to get peer feedback.
